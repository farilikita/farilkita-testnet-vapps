# vApp Proposal: TraceChain

## 1. Project Overview

* **Project Title:** TraceChain
* **Category:** infrastructure
* **GitHub Username:** [farilikita]
* **Discord ID:** [1381868341433733180]

### Short Description
TraceChain is a decentralized supply chain and product authentication platform. By creating a unique NFT "digital twin" for each physical product, TraceChain provides an immutable, transparent, and real-time audit trail from manufacturing to the end consumer. This enhances transparency, eliminates counterfeiting, and enables automated, trustless interactions between business partners.

## 2. Problem & Solution

### Problem
Traditional supply chains are notoriously opaque, fragmented, and inefficient. This lack of transparency leads to several critical issues:
1.  **Counterfeiting:** Consumers have no reliable way to verify the authenticity and origin of high-value goods.
2.  **Inefficiency:** Manual tracking and payment processes between multiple partners (manufacturers, logistics, retailers) are slow and prone to errors.
3.  **Lack of Trust:** Disputes over delivery times, product conditions, and payments are common due to the absence of a single, shared source of truth.

### Solution
TraceChain leverages the SL blockchain to create a single, immutable source of truth for the entire supply chain.
1.  **Digital Twin:** At the point of creation, each product is assigned a unique NFT that acts as its digital identity, linked via a QR code or NFC tag.
2.  **Immutable Ledger:** Every step of the product's journey—from leaving the factory to being shipped and stocked—is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain by scanning its physical tag. This creates a transparent and tamper-proof history.
3.  **Automated Value Exchange:** Smart contracts automate business logic, such as releasing payments from escrow to a shipping partner automatically upon confirmed delivery, drastically reducing administrative overhead and building trust.
4.  **Consumer Confidence:** The end consumer can scan the product's tag with their smartphone to instantly view its entire provenance, guaranteeing authenticity.

## 3. Technical Architecture & SL Integration

Our architecture is designed as a B2B platform that also provides a simple, direct interface for consumer verification.

* **Frontend:** A multi-faceted web application built with **React (Next.js)**:
    * **Business Dashboard:** A portal for manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to manage their product inventory, mint new digital twins, and track shipments.
    * **Mobile Scanner App/PWA:** A simple interface for supply chain partners to scan tags and update a product's status on the blockchain.
    * **Consumer Verification Page:** A public-facing, mobile-friendly page for consumers to scan a tag and view the product's history.
* **Backend:** A **Node.js** service will manage business accounts, integrate with the blockchain, and provide APIs for the frontend applications. It can also be designed to integrate with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in the future.
* **Physical-to-Digital Link:** Secure QR codes or NFC (Near-Field Communication) tags will be physically attached to each product.

### SL Integration
The SL blockchain is the core of TraceChain's trust and automation capabilities.
1.  **NFT as Product Identity (ERC-721):** We will use the ERC-721 standard on SL for unique, high-value items, as each token represents one specific, non-fungible product.
2.  **On-Chain State Machine:** The NFT's smart contract will act as a state machine. It will have functions like `updateStatus(newStatus, location)`, which can only be called by authorized partner wallets (e.g., a logistics company's address), effectively tracking the product's state (e.g., `In-Transit`, `Delivered`).
3.  **Escrow & Payment Contracts:** For business logic, we will deploy separate smart contracts that hold funds in escrow. These contracts will listen for specific state changes on the product's NFT. For example, when an NFT's status is updated to `Delivered`, the escrow contract automatically releases payment to the logistics partner.

## 4. Development Timeline

Our 8-week Proof-of-Concept (PoC) will focus on demonstrating the end-to-end lifecycle of a single product.

* **Week 1-2: Smart Contract Foundation**
    * Design and develop the core ERC-721 NFT contract with state-tracking functions and role-based access control.
    * Create a basic version of the payment escrow smart contract.
    * Write comprehensive tests for all on-chain logic.

* **Week 3-4: Backend & Manufacturer Portal**
    * Build the backend service for managing products and interacting with the smart contracts.
    * Develop the frontend portal for manufacturers to mint a new NFT "digital twin" for a product and generate its corresponding QR code.

* **Week 5-6: Logistics Partner Interface & Tracking**
    * Create the simple mobile web app (PWA) for a logistics partner to "scan" a QR code.
    * Implement the flow where the scan allows the authorized partner to call the `updateStatus` function on the smart contract to move the product to the next stage of its journey.

* **Week 7-8: Consumer Verification & Full Integration**
    * Build the public verification page where a consumer can scan the QR code and see the product's full, on-chain history.
    * Integrate all components and conduct end-to-end testing on a public testnet, simulating the journey from creation to final scan.
